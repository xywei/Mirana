!> Fortran interfaces for ITSOL2 (Found at http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/software/ITSOL/index.html).
!! @brief This module takes advantage of the ISO C binding module. 
!! The ISO C binding module was actually introduced as part of FORTRAN 2003 standard,
!! but your compiler may be willing to let your FORTRAN90 program access it.
!! Here we still write .90 files due to compatibility issues with Doxygen.
