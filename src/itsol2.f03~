module itsol2
  implicit none

  ! This module contains interfaces for the amos routines (in unmodified form
  ! found on http://netlib.org/amos).
  ! The slightly modified sources taken from SciPy's "legacy/amos/special"
  ! module are linked against.

  ! The original code was written by Donald E. Amos at Sandia National Labratories
  ! See also "Portable package for Bessel functions of a complex argument and
  ! non-negative order" by D. E. Amos in Trans. Math. Software (1986)

  ! Note that we made all routines pure routines. We do this to be able to
  ! use these routines in OpenMP loops and forall statements. The F77 routines
  ! are, of course, not declared as pure. However, they behave as such - the do
  ! not have side effects. Also, the intent of every argument is clear.
  ! Technically, there is one exception: the ?1mach.f90 routines (used in
  ! finding machine constants) each contain a write statement in case the query
  ! fails. We ignore this possibility (as we trust the queries made by amos).
  ! The author of the wrapper uses this without any problems in production code.
