  - (#1477) make 13GB be shown as 13.0GB so it's the same width as 13.1GB
  - (#1508) add watchfd tests
  - (#1510) option "--progress-from FILE", read last number and use it as bytes read:
    pv --progress-from <( while sleep 1; do du -sb somedir; done ) -s 123g

  - (#1290) look at effect of O_SYNC or fsync on performance
  - (#1281) option (-x?) to use xterm title line for status (Joachim Haga)
  - (#1287) if the first pv exits, should the second become IPC leader?
